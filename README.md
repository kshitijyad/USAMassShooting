### Context

Mass Shootings in the United States of America (1966-2017)
The US has witnessed 398 mass shootings in last 50 years that resulted in 1,996 deaths and 2,488 injured. The latest and the worst mass shooting of October 2, 2017 killed 58 and injured 515 so far. The number of people injured in this attack is more than the number of people injured in all mass shootings of 2015 and 2016 combined. 
The average number of mass shootings per year is 7 for the last 50 years that would claim 39 lives and 48 injured per year.

### Acknowledgements

I’ve consulted several public datasets and web pages to compile this data.  Some of the major data sources include [Wikipedia][1], [Mother Jones][2], [Stanford][3], [USA Today][4] and other web sources. 

### Inspiration

With a broken heart, I like to call the attention of my fellow Kagglers to use Machine Learning and Data Sciences to help me explore these ideas:

•	How many people got killed and injured per year?

•	Visualize mass shootings on the U.S map

•	Is there any correlation between shooter and his/her race, gender

•	Any correlation with calendar dates? Do we have more deadly days, weeks or months on average

•	What cities and states are more prone to such attacks

•	Can you find and combine any other external datasets to enrich the analysis, for example, gun ownership by state

•	Any other pattern you see that can help in prediction, crowd safety or in-depth analysis of the event

•	How many shooters have some kind of mental health problem? Can we compare that shooter with general population with same condition

### Mass Shootings Dataset Ver 3

This is the new Version of Mass Shootings Dataset. I've added eight new variables:

1.       Incident Area (where the incident took place), 
2.       Open/Close Location (Inside a building or open space) 
3.       Target (possible target audience or company), 
4.       Cause (Terrorism, Hate Crime, Fun (for no obvious reason etc.)
5.       Policeman Killed (how many on duty officers got killed)
6.       Age (age of the shooter)
7.       Employed (Y/N) 
8.       Employed at  (Employer Name)

Age, Employed and Employed at (3 variables) contain shooter details

### Mass Shootings Dataset Ver 4

Quite a few missing values have been added

### Mass Shootings Dataset Ver 5

Three more recent mass shootings have been added including the Texas Church shooting of November 5, 2017


I hope it will help create more visualization and extract patterns.
